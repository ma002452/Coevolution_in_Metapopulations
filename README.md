# Time delays drive coevolutionary dynamics in consumer-resource metapopulations

This repository contains the research works that I've done for 2 years and half under the supervision of Dr. Kenichi Okamoto at the University of St. Thomas. You can find all the details about the work under the following files:
1. *kwokamoto-coevolution_in_metapopulations1-963ff08cb641.zip* --> This zip file contains all the codes to run the model.
2. *Ma_Proposal_Spring2024.pdf* --> This is the proposal form that I wrote and submitted to the UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program) in order to receive Collaborative Inquiry Grant. The proposal was accepted, and I received the grant.
3. *UROP_finalReport.docx* --> This is the final report of the research that I submitted to the UROP as the part of the Collaborative Inquiry Grant requirements.
4. *InquiryPoster.jpg* --> This is the poster that I made for the inquiry poster session which was also the part of the Collaborative Inquiry Grant requirements.
